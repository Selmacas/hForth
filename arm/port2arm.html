Porting hForth to the StrongArm SA-110 RISC processor</H1>
by Neal Crook

<P><I>This article originally appeared (in slightly different form) In
Forth Dimensions XX/3 (September/October 1998).</I>
<H2>
Background</H2>
Once upon a time I downloaded Julian Noble's FPRIMER.ZIP from a SIMTEL
archive and discovered eForth V1.0. I was fascinated by the way that eForth
used an assembler's macro expansion capability to generate all of the header
and dictionary structures for a Forth compiler. I ported eForth to the
Z80 (not knowing that this had already been done) - I chose the Z80 because
I was familiar with it and I had a development environment for it. Doing
the Z80 port was not useful, except as a Great Learning Experience.

<P>At the time that I started playing with eForth, I was working for Digital
Equipment Corporation's semiconductor division (Digital Semiconductor,
DS) as an applications engineer. Having completed the eForth port to the
Z80 I was casting around for another fun spare-time project, and I naturally
settled upon the idea of doing a port to the 64-bit Alpha RISC processor.
However, before I could get started on this project, DS took a license
for the Advanced RISC Machines Ltd ARM architecture, and announced that
it was developing StrongArm. My group won the task of supporting StrongArm
chip sales, and I started work on the design of a board that would be used
as a hardware verification and evaluation platform for the first StrongArm
chip, the SA-110.

<P>When the board design was completed I had about a month to spare whilst
the board was in layout and manufacture. The SA-110 itself was still in
the last stages of design. I took some code examples from another engineer,
who was writing the diagnostic and test code, and set about the task of
learning ARM assembler programming, with a view to porting eForth to the
SA-110.

<P>I debugged the ARM eForth port on an instruction-set simulator, and
then on an ARM610 processor evaluation board. Meanwhile, my board had come
back from assembly and I had done as much testing as you can do on a processor
board when it has no processor. Boards were shipped to Austin, Texas where
the SA-110 design team were headquartered, and I eagerly awaited SA-110
prototypes.

<P>Finally, we had word that the SA-110 was due out of fab imminently.
Myself and a software engineer travelled to Austin. We powered the very
first SA-110 chip up in the last week of November, 1995 and, within a day,
the diagnostics were up and running (well done, Anthony). The code for
talking to the debug tools presented more of a problem and there wasn't
much I could do to help. It was time to blow an EPROM on my own account..

<P>A couple of days (and many cycles through the EPROM eraser) later eForth
was up and running (it was the third or fourth program ever to run on SA-110
silicon). It was immediately useful for writing code one-liners to exercise
logic and measure power consumption. In addition, I added facilities to
allow the processor's caches to be turned on and off under software control
so that we could measure the impact on speed and power consumption.

<P>Overall, eForth proved to be very useful during the course of the project,
but in the meantime I had discovered the ANS standard, and I wanted to
try some of the features that eForth lacked. I began to modify eForth to
bring it in line with the ANS standard. One day, during a bit of web browsing,
I came across Dr Wonyong Koh's hForth[1]. When I saw what Dr Koh had achieved,
using eForth as a starting point, I abandoned eForth and started a port
of hForth.

hForth is a direct threaded code (DTC) Forth, and it is designed to be
built using a macro assembler. Macros are used in the source code to express
Forth constructs like constants, variables, colon definitions and code
definitions. To simplify the porting effort, a minimal number of definitions
must be coded in assembler; the remainder are colon definitions. The first
step in the porting process is to map registers of the Forth virtual machine
to real registers in the target processor. The ARM has 15 general-purpose
registers, named R0 through R14; R15 is the program counter. R14 has a
special role during subroutine calls; it stores the return address from
the subroutine (unlike CISC processors, RISC processors do not tend to
have dedicated hardware stack pointers). The instruction set is highly
orthogonal (another RISC characteristic) so it makes little difference
which register is used for which function. I chose this register assignment:

<P>The assembler source defines aliases for these four registers so that
they can be referred to by name.

<P>Having allocated registers, the second stage in the porting process
is to design the virtual machine and code the low-level routines. The main
difference between eForth and hForth in these areas is that hForth uses
the common technique of keeping top-of-stack in a processor register. That
meant that I could reuse much of my existing code with only minor modifications.
In any case, the amount of work is small; in ARM assembler the longest
"required" code definition is about 10 lines of assembler code. The hForth
source highlights a number of words that should be coded in assembler for
speed, but also provides colon definitions that can be used during the
initial debug of a new port.
<H4>
Example code fragments</H4>
This section shows how hForth definitions are expressed in the assembler
source and how the macros expand to generate code for the target. The ARM
and 8086 implementations are compared by considering this colon definition:

<P><TT>: DOUBLE ( n -- n ) DUP + ;</TT>

<P>In the source code, this could be represented as a colon definition,
which would be portable across processors:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $COLON 6,'DOUBLE',DUBBLE,_SLINK</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFW DUP,PLUS,EXIT</TT>

<P>"$COLON" is a macro that expands to perform 3 tasks:
<UL>
<LI>
Generate an entry in the name dictionary for the word DOUBLE, and associate
an XT with the name. The value of the XT is the assembler label DUBBLE,
and its value is a forward reference that will be resolved by the assembler
in the usual way. "_SLINK" is an assembler variable that is used to build
a link to the previous entry in the name dictionary. By using different
variables here, multiple wordlists can be intertwined in the name dictionary.</LI>

<LI>
Generate a label in the code dictionary with the name DUBBLE</LI>

<LI>
Generate a processor-dependent call to the inner interpreter, DoLIST.</LI>
</UL>
"DEFW" is an assembler pseudo-op, and is followed by a list of labels.
Each label corresponds to an XT that will have been created by some other
macro expansion. The labels may be forward or backward references because
they will all be resolved by the assembler in the usual way. In this example,
the values will be the XTs for "DUP", "+" and "EXIT" respectively.

<P>For the 8086, the cell size is 16 bits and the opcode size is variable.
The call to the inner interpreter is a call to an absolute address. The
opcode for CALL is 1 byte, and so this is prefixed with a 1-byte NOP to
keep the code aligned to a cell boundary. The definition looks like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; NOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1 byte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } Macro expansion..
processor</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; CALL DoLIST&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 + 2 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} native code</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; XT-DUP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2
bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; XT-+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } Executed by inner interpreter</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; XT-EXIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} on Forth Virtual Machine</TT>

<P>DoLIST is a label, resolved by the assembler. The XTs are absolute addresses.
The CALL pushes a return address onto the hardware stack and this return
address is used by the inner interpreter to access the XTs that make up
the definition.

<P>For the ARM, the cell size and the opcode size are both 32 bits; the
definition looks like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; BL DoLIST 4 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} Macro expansion.. processor</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
native code</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; XT-DUP 4 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; XT-+ 4 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} Executed by inner interpreter</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; XT-EXIT 4 bytes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} on Forth Virtual Machine</TT>

<P>The BL (branch-and-link) instruction is a single 32-bit opcode. Rather
than specifying an absolute address, the branch destination (to the label
DoLIST) is encoded as a 24-bit, signed, PC-relative offset within the opcode.
This only makes a sub-set of the 32-bit address space accessible, but the
range is more than adequate. As before, the XTs are absolute addresses.
The BL stores a return address in the processor register R14 (R14 must
be preserved before another BL can be executed). The value of R14 is used
by the inner interpreter to access the XTs that make up the definition.

<P>The result of using the $COLON macro is that the colon definition of
DOUBLE is portable, even though the macro and result of the macro expansion
are not portable. Next, we will look at how the same definition would be
expressed as a (processor-dependent) code definition. For the 8086 it looks
like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $CODE 6,'DOUBLE',DUBBLE,_SLINK</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; MOV AX, BX</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; ADD BX, AX</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $NEXT</TT>

<P>While for the ARM it looks like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $CODE 6,'DOUBLE',DUBBLE,_SLINK</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; ADD tos,tos,tos</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $NEXT</TT>

<P>The macro "$CODE" expands out to generate a label and a name dictionary
entry as before, but does not generate anything in the code dictionary.
The macro "$NEXT" terminates the definition by returning control to the
caller of this definition. Everything in between is expanded by the assembler
to generate opcodes for the particular processor. Remember that "tos" is
simply an alias for the register R9, which is used to hold the top-of-stack
value.

<P>For the 8086, the expansion of $NEXT generates this code:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; LODSW&nbsp; ; get the next code address into AX</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; JMP AX ; jump directly to the code address</TT>

<P>Whilst for the ARM, the expansion of $NEXT generates this code:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; MOV pc,[fpc], #CELLL</TT>

<P>This instruction can be read as "load the PC (ie branch to) with the
value that is stored in the cell addressed by the current value of fpc,
and post-increment fpc (by the cell-size) to address the subsequent cell".

<P>To understand these examples more clearly we need to see how the inner
interpreter, DoLIST, is implemented. Remember from the discussion above
that DoLIST takes an input parameter; the address of the first XT to be
executed, and that this parameter is passed to the DoLIST code in a processor-specific
way:
<UL>
<LI>
For the 8086, DoLIST is entered through a native CALL, and the parameter
is passed on the hardware stack since it is the return address for the
call.</LI>

<LI>
For the ARM, DoLIST is entered through a native BL and the parameter is
passed in R14, since this is the return (link) address for the BL.</LI>
</UL>
For the 8086, DoLIST looks like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $CODE COMPO+6,'doLIST',DoLIST,_SLINK</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; SUB BP,2</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; MOV [BP],SI ;push return stack</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; POP SI ;new list address</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $NEXT</TT>

<P>For the ARM, DoLIST looks like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $CODE COMPO+6,'doLIST',DoLIST,_SLINK</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; STR fpc, [rsp, # - CELLL]! ;preserve forth PC</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; MOV fpc, R14 ;first xt of definition</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; $NEXT</TT>

<P>The STR (store) instruction performs a store of the current fpc value
onto the return stack and then updates the fpc with the parameter passed
in R14. The "[rsp , # - CELLL]!" means store at the location addressed
by rsp but first decrement rsp by the value of CELLL -- in other words,
this instruction implements a "push" with rsp as the stack pointer and
fpc as the data.

<P>Now that we've seen how definitions are generated by the assembler,
there's one final thing we need to consider; the processor-dependent parts
of generating a new definition when hForth is up and running on the target.
Again, we will consider the definition for DOUBLE.

<P>The only processor-dependent part of the compilation process is the
generation and detection of the call to DoLIST. In hForth this is handled
by the words "?call" and "xt,". "?call" is used to check whether a given
location contains a direct threaded code call; it is used for optimisation
purposes and by SEE (the word decompiler). "xt," takes an XT as a parameter
and compiles a direct threaded code call to that location.

<P>8086 versions, where call-code is 0xE890 (opcode for a NOP followed
by a CALL):

<P><TT>: ?call&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DUP @ call-code =</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; IF CELL+ DUP @ SWAP CELL+ DUP ROT + EXIT THEN</TT>

SA-110, and it is discussed further below.&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="Tool chain"></A>Tool chain</H3>
eForth and hForth both rely on macro expansion in an 8086 assembler in
order to build code and name dictionaries for the target image. Some ports
to other processors have continued to use the 8086 macro assembler; in
this technique, the low-level words are hand-assembled and edited into
the assembler source files as DEFW (define word) statements. This is somewhat
tedious but entirely effective. That technique was unsuitable for the ARM
port because the 8086 macro assembler is designed to use 16-bit addresses
whereas the ARM uses 32-bit addresses. Therefore, it was logical to use
the assembler and linker in ARM Ltd's Software Development Toolkit (SDT).
This is where I hit a major problem. The macros work by repeatedly changing
the value of "ORG" -- the position in the target image at which code/data
is being generated. They do this because each macro expansion generatess
stuff in both the code dictionary and name dictionary, and these are in
separate memory areas. The problem is that the ARM assembler does not allow
ORG to be changed. (At the time that I learned this, it came as something
of a shock. I have since learnt that it is a common restriction in modern
single-pass assemblers).

<P>The only solution to this problem was to change the structure of the
assembler source so that every definition was broken into two parts (one
that generated code dictionary entry and one that generated name dictionary
entry). Rather than embarking on a major editing session, I used the scripting
language, AWK to process the assembler source. I ended up with three separate
scripts:
<UL>
<LI>
The first script mades syntax changes to the assembler source to suit the
ARM assembler</LI>

<LI>
The second script expands all the macros and generates three output files;
one representing the code dictionary, one representing the name dictionary
and one representing a jump table and ASCII strings for the system THROW
(error) messages</LI>

<LI>
The third script reverses the order of the entries in the name dictionary
so that entries logically grow down from high memory</LI>
</UL>
The assembler source is run through these three scripts and the three output
files (code dictionary, reversed name dictionary and throw table) are concatenated
and fed through the ARM assembler. The final stage is to link them using
the ARM linker. The entire build processs takes about 5 seconds.

<P>The AWK scripts took some weeks to develop, but I had already made that
investment for eForth, and the modifications for hForth were relatively
minor (for example, adding the throw table, since this was not present
in eForth). The whole process had a major benefit that I did not anticipate;
my assembler source file had a relatively small number of changes from
the 8086 version. When Dr Koh made new releases of his code, I was able
to use the excellent "ediff" feature in GNU Emacs to view differences between
my old code and Dr Koh's new release, and patch (with a single keystroke)
any revision that affected my port.
<H3>
<A NAME="Portability issues"></A>Portability issues</H3>
eForth and hForth were originally written for a 16-bit processor, the 8086,
with a 16-bit cell size. My target machine was a 32-bit processor, with
a 32-bit cell size. I had found a couple of places in eForth (loop counters
in the division and multiplication routines) where the code relied on a
16-bit cell size and I had changed these to get the 32-bit version working.
I checked for these same problems in hForth but I found that they had already
been abstracted to a constant, cell-size-in-bits. I was later able to conclude
that there were no portability issues in the code related to cell size
(at least, none that affected the transition from 16 to 32 bits). In addition,
as Dr Koh predicted[1], the multi-tasker ran without modification.

<P>One area that limited portabilty was an environment string called systemID.
As previously described in [1], hForth has three closely associated implementations;
ROM model, RAM model and EXE model. Different assembler source code is
used to build each model, and generates the basic kernel of the Forth system.
Additional functionality is added by INCLUDEing Forth source files on the
running system. The definitions in these files are coded to work correctly
for any of the models. Where data structures vary for the different models,
systemID is tested to see which version to use. Originally, the environment
string systemID expanded to "8086 ROM Model". For the ARM port, this was
changed to "ARM ROM Model", but this stopped the Forth source files from
working. Dr Koh revised hForth to solve this problem; he split the environment
string into two parts; CPU (for example, "8086") and Model (for example,
"ROM Model"). As a result, most of the high-level files only needed to
test Model, and became CPU-independent. The only time where the CPU environment
string must be tested is for definitions that use (CPU-dependent) assembler.
For example:

<P><TT>CHAR " PARSE CPU" ENVIRONMENT? DROP</TT>
<BR><TT>CHAR " PARSE 8086" COMPARE</TT>
<BR><TT>[IF] DROP</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; CODE D-</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; BX DX MOV, AX POP, BX POP, CX POP, AX CX SUB,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; CX PUSH, DX BX SBB, NEXT,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; END-CODE</TT>
<BR><TT>[ELSE]</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; : D- DNEGATE D+ ;</TT>
<BR><TT>[THEN]</TT>
<H2>
Additions to the functionality</H2>
In addition to re-coding the low-level routines, I made these modifications
to hForth:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="#I/O routines">Changed the I/O to support simple terminal I/O
and file download</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="#debugging">Added some primitive code to help in the debug of
new ports</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="#Caches">Added support for processor caches</A></LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="I/O routines"></A>I/O routines</H3>
The 8086 hForth is designed to run under MSDOS. It uses software interrupts
to DOS to perform character I/O and file I/O. My target platforms had no
underlying operating environment and so I had to write initialisation code
for the system memory controller and I/O devices, and character input and
output routines to control a UART. I connected to the UART on the target
using an RS232 connection from a PC running a terminal emulator.

<P>I added a simple file download function, which relies on a ASCII file
download from the terminal emulator and XON/XOFF flow control within hForth.
This facility copies the FILE/HAND technique used by eForth.

<P>All of the target boards that I ran hForth on had on-board Flash ROM.
hForth was stored in ROM but copied into RAM at startup so that it would
run more quickly. I added Forth definitions to allow me to take a running
RAM image of hForth (including all the definitions that had been added
interactively or by file download) and program this image back into Flash.
<H3>
<A NAME="debugging"></A>Debugging</H3>
The initial debug of both the eForth and hForth ports was done using ARM
Ltd's SDT. This includes an instruction set simulator that runs under the
control of a debugger to allow single-stepping, source-level debug and
breakpointing.

<P>Both eForth and hForth use a minimal number of words defined in machine
code (code definitions); the bulk of the image consists of the name dictionary
(which the debugger just treats as data) and threaded lists of execution
tokens. By definition, a breakpoint can only be set on an opcode, and for
a DTC Forth there is only one opcode in each colon definition; the DTC
call to DoLIST.

<P>Simply trapping on the call to DoLIST leads to multiple unwanted traps.
For example, consider a definition that includes this fragment:

<P><TT>R> SWAP 2DUP + ALIGNED >R</TT>

<P>If a breakpoint is set on the call to DoLIST for each of these words,
the breakpoint would also be triggered if, for example, the definition
of ALIGNED used SWAP. It would be useful to step through each word in turn
(and check the effect upon the stacks and other data areas) without diving
down into other definitions. The threaded nature of the code makes it very
difficult to step through a particular definition in this way using breakpoints.

<P>Conventional Forth programming philosophy encourages you to test and
debug each low-level word and work your way upwards to a complete debugged
program. However, when you are trying to bring up Forth with no particular
tools to help you, you have no "test harness" to exercise a word other
than the entirety of the Forth compiler.

<P>My solution to this problem was to modify $NEXT to implement a "micro
debugger", uDebug.

<P>All definitions end with $NEXT -- either directly (code definitions)
or indirectly (colon definitions terminating in EXIT, which is itself a
code definition). The normal action of $NEXT is to use the fpc to fetch
the XT of the next word and jump to it. The modified action of $NEXT is
to make a jump (not a call) to the routine uDebug. Invoking this modified
behaviour is a build-time option that requires you to reassemble the code.

<P>In ARM assembler, uDebug looks like this:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; uDebug ldr r0,=AddrTrapfpc</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; ldr r1,[r0]</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; cmps r1,fpc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; compare the stored address with</TT>

<P>To invoke uDebug for a particular definition:
<OL>
<LI>
Set a debugger breakpoint at the DTC call to DoLIST at the start of the
definition to be debugged, and run until you hit this breakpoint.</LI>

<LI>
Load the location trapfpc with the address of the first XT in the definition
to be debugged.</LI>

<LI>
Set a debugger breakpoint on the final instruction in the uDebug routine.</LI>
</OL>
When you run the code, the debugger will now trap after the execution of
the first XT in the definition. Run again and it will stop after the execution
of the second. To disable uDebug, set the location trapfpc to 0.

<P>This technique has a number of limitations:
<UL>
<LI>
It depends upon an XT of 0 being illegal (since this acts as a magic value
to turn uDebug off)</LI>

<LI>
It does not allow you to automatically debug a code stream that includes
inline string definitions, or any other kind of inline literal; you must
step into the word that includes the definition then hand-edit the appropriate
new value into trapfpc.</LI>
</UL>
These limitations could be overcome by making uDebug more complex -- but
at a risk of introducing bugs into the debugger code itself. uDebug has
now been incorporated into Dr Koh's hForth source.

<P>Another technique that I used early in eforth debug was even simpler;
a definition called DXIT, which has identical behaviour to EXIT, but with
a different XT. To use this to debug a definition:
<OL>
<LI>
Set a debugger breakpoint on the DTC call at the start of DXIT</LI>

<LI>
In the definition to be debugged, patch the XT of EXIT with the XT of DXIT</LI>
</OL>
Now when you run the code, the debugger will trap at the end of the definition
to be debugged; an ideal point at which to examine the stack effects. A
duplicate DoLIST could be used in a similar way but, for the ARM, patching
in a BL to DoLIST requires a fiddly calculation of a relative offset.

<P>Once hForth was up and running on my target hardware, I re-coded some
colon definitions as code definitions, to improve performance. I started
by giving a code definition a different name from its colon definition
and debugging it interactively. After testing, I replaced the colon definition
with the code definition and reassembled.
<H3>
<A NAME="Caches"></A>Caches</H3>
Everything that has been described so far applies equally to SA-110 and
any other ARM processor. However, the architecture of the SA-110 caches
differs from that of earlier ARM processors. In common with many RISC processors,
but unusually for an ARM processor, the SA-110 has a modified Harvard architecture;
separate instruction and data caches but a unified 32-bit address space
accessed through a single external bus interface. This cache architecture
introduced two problems for the hForth port:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="#Cache coherence">Keeping the I-cache coherent during code generation</A></LI>

<LI>
<A HREF="#Cache utilisation">Achieving high cache utilisation</A></LI>
</UL>

<H4>
<A NAME="Cache coherence"></A>Cache coherence</H4>
As is usual on RISC processors, the SA-110 has no hardware mechanism to
keep the I-cache coherent with the rest of the system (D-cache and main
memory). Therefore, whenever a value is written into memory and that value
is to be used as an opcode, the coherence of the caches must be enforced
under software control. This has two well-known consequences:
<UL>
<LI>
Self-modifying code requires careful attention</LI>

<LI>
After loading a new executable image into memory, the caches must be flushed
before the code can be executed</LI>
</UL>
Forth can be regarded as a special case of self-modifying code, in the
sense that an image that is executing makes additions to its own code space.
When hForth is running, the only opcode generated is the "BL DoLIST" at
the start of a definition. This is generated by "xt," and so, for the ARM
port, "xt," was modified by the addition of a call to "IDflushline". The
function of IDflushline is to take an address and to force cache coherence
at that address. The SA-110 has a write-through data cache and therefore,
the sequence performed by IDflushline is:
<UL>
<LI>
Clean D-cache entry at this address (force dirty data line to main memory)</LI>

<LI>
Flush I-cache entry (force a cache miss at this address)</LI>
</UL>
Subsequently, an opcode fetch from the address will cause the I-cache to
miss and force the opcode to be fetched from main memory.

<P>For a system without caches, or where I-cache coherence is enforced
in hardware, IDflushline can simply be "DROP".
<H4>
<A NAME="Cache utilisation"></A>Cache utilisation</H4>
Consider what happens when the colon definition of DOUBLE is executed for
the first time. Recall that the definition occupies 16 bytes:

<P><TT>[BL DoLIST] [XT-DUP] [XT-+] [XT-EXIT]</TT>

<P>To start execution of the word, the SA-110's program counter is loaded
with the address of the "BL DoLIST". The SA-110 checks the I-cache to see
if a value for this address is present, and cache misses. A cache miss
is serviced by loading a naturally-aligned block of 8 32-bit words from
main memory into the cache (in this case, the I-cache). The size of the
block is called the "line size", and results in 7 other 32-bit words being
read into the I-cache. Depending upon the alignment of DOUBLE in memory,
some of these words may be part of the definition of DOUBLE or they may
be values associated with earlier or later definitions in memory. Once
the cache-miss data has been loaded, the SA-110 executes the BL and branches
to the inner interpreter which will generate a fetch from the address at
which [XT-DUP] is stored. This fetch is a *data* fetch, and so the SA-110
checks the D-cache and, again, cache misses. Again, the miss is serviced
by loading a naturally-aligned block of 8 32-bit words into the D-cache.
Often, these will be exactly the same 8 words that are already stored in
the I-cache.

<P>This example shows that intermingling code and data leads to low cache
utilisation; the I-cache is polluted with XTs that can only be used as
data and, to a lesser extent, the D-cache is polluted with branches to
DoLIST, which can only be executed as instructions.

<P>Cache utilisation is a "figure of merit" for a piece of code; it is
calculated as the proportion of values that, having been loaded into a
cache line, are subsequently used at least once before being discarded
to make way for some other value. Low cache utilisation reduces performance
for two reasons:
<UL>
<LI>
The processor is stalled whilst the cache line is loaded; loading values
that never get used wastes processing cycles</LI>

<LI>
Compared with an ideal system (one with full cache utilisation), the system
performs as though it had a cache that is only a fraction of its actual
size.</LI>
</UL>
Intermingled code and data would be more appropriate for a system with
a unified cache, but this architecture is rarely used in high-performance
systems because a modified Harvard architecture is an easy way of increasing
the instruction/data bandwidth into a processor core.

<P>For the SA-110, the cache utilisation could be improved dramatically
by changing from a direct threaded code to a subroutine threaded code implementation.
This would eliminate the "BL DoLIST" at the start of each definition, and
change the list of XTs in a definition to a list of "BL" instructions.
The design of the compiler and decompiler would be complicated slightly,
but the whole thing could probably be factored efficiently and incorporated
into hForth as a build-time option.
<H2>
Applications of hForth</H2>
My use of hForth on SA110-based target systems has been for testing and
debugging hardware. Since the ARM port was released, there have been a
few sightings of its use elsewhere; including modifications to the build
procedure to support the use of the GNU ARM assembler/linker.
<H2>
Other projects in progress</H2>
The frustration of having to use AWK scripts to preprocess the assembler
source file led me to start thinking about other ways to generate an executable
image. Several Forth implementations have successfully used C as a source
environment, but I was reluctant to go down that path because the existing
structure of hForth makes it suitable for processors for which no C compiler
is available.

<P>The logical solution is to meta-compile hForth and thereby do away with
any external tool problems. I have a prototype system running on pfe (a
32-bit ANS Forth compiler) under Linux. After loading two ANS programs
(an ARM assembler and the meta-compiler) it it then possible to read in
the hForth source (somewhat modified, since the source is now entirely
expressed in Forth) and spit out an ARM binary. More about that in another
article...
<H2>
Conclusions</H2>
hForth lived up to its author's goal of being easily portable to other
processors. If you want a public-domain forth that runs on an embedded
target, it is worthy of serious consideration.

Acknowledgments</H2>
I am grateful for Dr Koh's timely responses to numerous emails when I asked
questions about various aspects of his implementation that were unclear
to me. We should all be grateful that Dr Koh was kind enough to take comments
and code fragments back from many people and use them to improve the clarity
and portability of his source code.

<P>Most of the work I did on porting hForth to the SA-110 was done in my
private time. However, some of it was also supported by my then-employer,
and I am grateful to acknowledge Digital Semiconductor's permission to
place all of this work in the public domain under the same restrictions
as Dr Koh's original work: ALL commercial and non-commerical uses are granted.
