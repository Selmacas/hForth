The following bugs exist in the latest hf86rom.asm source and have not been
reported to the author.


1.

;   THROWMsgTbl ( -- a-addr )			\ CORE

.. should not be labelled as "core"


2.

;   : pack"     OVER max-counted-string SWAP U< 

should be:

;   : pack"     OVER [ MaxCountedString ] LITERAL SWAP U< 

3. 

;   : 2DUP	DUP DUP ;

		$COLON	4,'2DUP',TwoDUP,_FLINK
		DW	OVER,OVER,EXIT

..high level defn should be : 2DUP OVER OVER ;

4.

;		notNONAME? IF	\ if the last definition is not created by ':'

.. shouldn't this say, "if the last definition is creared by ':'" ??

5.

;   linkLast	( -- )
;		Link the word being defined to the current wordlist.
;		Do nothing if the last definition is made by :NONAME .

.. I think "Do nothing..:NONAME." should be deleted. It appears that
linkLast *always* makes a link.

6. 

;   : UM/MOD	DUP 0= IF -10 THROW THEN	\ divide by zero
;		2DUP U< IF
;		   NEGATE [ cell-size-in-bits ] LITERAL 0
;		   DO	>R DUP um+ >R >R DUP um+ R> + DUP
;			R> R@ SWAP >R um+ R> OR
;			IF  >R DROP 1+ R>  ELSE  DROP  THEN

                        R>

;		   LOOP DROP SWAP EXIT
;		ELSE -11 THROW		\ result out of range
;		THEN ;

.. additional R> to match assembler definition.
